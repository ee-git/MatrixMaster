        <p class="paragraph lead text-justify">
          Feline fans, rejoice: Your cat isn't just a cute and cuddly ball of
          fluff -- he's also incredibly good for your health. Even pet owners
          who prefer puppies can't deny the major benefits that come along with
          caring for a furry friend of either species. Science shows that pets
          can help prevent allergies in kids, ward off respiratory infections,
          improve your mood and even boost self-esteem. Whether you're a crazy
          cat lady or a dude ready to publicly proclaim your obsession with your
          feline friend, get ready to celebrate the many pros of being a proud
          cat owner -- all negative stereotypes aside.

        â€” It's the news cat owners have been waiting for: Owning lots of cats
        does not, in fact, mean you're mad, sad or anxious. That's according
        to researchers at UCLA, who analyzed more than 500 pet owners and
        found nothing to support the long-held "crazy cat lady" stereotype.
        The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science,
        observed how people reacted to distress calls from animals and also
        compared pet ownership with mental health-related or social
        difficulties. Its results will come as a relief to those people who,
        absurdly, prefer cats to dogs -- and should give those who cling to
        the popular "cat lady" trope paws for thought. "We found no evidence
        to support the 'cat lady' stereotype: cat-owners did not differ from
        others on self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety or their
        experiences in close relationships," the study said. "Our findings,
        therefore, do not fit with the notion of cat-owners as more depressed,
        anxious or alone." The conclusion backs a similar finding by
        researchers at University College London, who said in 2017 that they
        found no link between cat ownership and the development of psychotic
        symptoms.
